//! # Simulation parameter configuration
//!
//! REMS expects you to define a simulation by providing it with a YAML file describing all the
//! parameters. Here is an example config showing all available options, with commented default
//! options:
//!
//! ```
//! ---
//! ## How many dimensions we have in space. Right now, only 1 is supported.
//! dimensions: 1
//! ## Define a list of signals
//! signals:
//!   ## This signal is at location 600 in space
//!   - location: 600
//!     ## Read this path to get the signal. See below for a description of this file.
//!     path: examples/1d_signal.bson
//! ## Define how large the universe should be, in cells
//! size: 1920
//! ## Define how many time steps the simulation should run for
//! time: 32768
//! ## This is a list of oscilloscopes, or outputs for your simulation. Right now, only the movie
//! ## type is supported, but one could imagine other types added in the future.
//! oscilloscopes:
//!   - type: movie
//!     # How large of a magnitude to use for the y-axis on the graphs
//!     ## range: 1.0
//!     ## The path to write the movie to
//!     path: examples/1d_simulation.mp4
//!     ## The framerate of the resulting movie, in Hz
//!     ## framerate: 60
//!     ## How often to generate a graph in simulation time steps
//!     ## graph_period: 16
//!     ## The resolution you desire for the resulting video, expressed as an array of two integers
//!     ## resolution:
//!     ##   - 1920
//!     ##   - 1080
//!     ## How many snapshots to buffer in memory before handing them off to a Python subprocess to
//!     ## generate graphs out of them.
//!     ## snapshot_buffer_len: 47
//! ```
//!
//! # The signal BSON file
//!
//! The signals should be defined in a BSON file, with three fields: ```ex```, ```_version```, and
//! ```dimensions```. ```_version``` should be set to 0, ```dimensions``` should be set to 1, and
//! ```ex``` should be an array of floating point numbers that express which value the signal
//! should have for each time step in the simulation. Here is a YAML example that corresponds in
//! spirit to that schema:
//!
//! ```
//! ---
//! _version: 0
//! dimensions: 1
//! ex:
//!   - 0.0
//!   - 0.1
//!   - 0.2
//!   - 0.3
//! ```
